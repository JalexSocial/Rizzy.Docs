Minimal APIs in .NET 8 offer a streamlined approach for building HTTP APIs and web applications with less boilerplate code. They are designed to make the development process faster and more efficient, allowing developers to focus on the business logic rather than the underlying infrastructure. Minimal APIs are ideal for small to medium-sized projects and microservices, providing a simple yet powerful way to handle requests and responses.
