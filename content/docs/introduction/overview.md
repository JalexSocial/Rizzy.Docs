Rizzy is a lightweight library that enhances Asp.net MVC applications by seamlessly integrating Razor components for UI development and working with HTMX for progressive enhancement. With Rizzy, you can leverage the power of composable Razor components to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces while ensuring a smooth user experience through HTMX.

## Why Asp.net MVC?

Asp.net MVC is a very mature and stable platform. Leveraging Asp.net MVC with Razor Components and HTMX creates a highly efficient and modern web development stack for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: Combining server-side Razor Components with client-side updates via HTMX enhances app speed and responsiveness.
2. **Development Efficiency**: The modularity of Razor Components and MVC's architecture simplifies building and maintaining complex applications.
3. **Integration**: HTMX complements this stack by enabling dynamic HTML updates without extensive JavaScript, fitting seamlessly with Razor Components for interactive UIs.
4. **Rich Ecosystem**: .NET's comprehensive tooling and libraries streamline development, debugging, and testing processes.
5. **Security**: Built-in protections against common web threats ensure the development of secure applications compliant with web standards.

This stack offers a balanced approach to web development, merging server-side stability with client-side interactivity, all while maintaining a focus on security and developer productivity.
