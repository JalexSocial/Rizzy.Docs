## Why Asp.net MVC?

Asp.net MVC is a very mature and stable platform. Combining Asp.net MVC with Razor Components and HTMX can form the foundation of a modern web development stack:

1. **Performance**: Combining server-side Razor Components with client-side updates via HTMX enhances app speed and responsiveness.
2. **Development Efficiency**: The modularity of Razor Components simplify building and maintaining complex applications.
3. **Integration**: HTMX complements this stack by enabling dynamic HTML updates without extensive JavaScript
4. **Rich Ecosystem**: .NET's comprehensive tooling and libraries streamline development, debugging, and testing processes.
5. **Security**: Built-in protections against common web threats ensure the development of secure applications compliant with web standards.

This stack offers a balanced approach to web development, merging server-side stability with client-side interactivity.
